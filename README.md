# **Description**
This project is the first one I've created using React, so I thought it'd be important to focus on making something valuable to others. After four arduous months, I've finally built something that's ultimately half-baked but still rewarding. Please watch the [Youtube video](g) on this project to learn more about it and my thoughts on it as a whole. Also, if you enjoyed the video, please like, share, & share it to support me.

Newfound skills:
* Transferring data to/from a database
* Creating dynamic content using data from a database
